Vehicle Matrix File - Is a matrix of required vehicles to look up and chart within Excel from www.carvana.com. The file has listed Specific Makes, Type, and 3 Models per type, if there were vehicles that did not fit within the initial requirements I located additional variants. The additional variants were Year, Engine Type (Gas or Diesel), Doors (2 or 4), and Color.
